# Sharpon
just some code editor because can. <br>
This code editor is mainly intended for C# but can be used to edit anything. <br>
Sharpon also doesnt support mouse input so its keyboard only

## How to install
- Download the right version for your operating system from the releases page
- Unzip the file and find the Sharpon.exe in the publish directory (or just Sharpon if you're on linux)
- Windows defender will tell you that this is a virus but its probably not
<br>

## Keybinds
`Ctrl+Shift+P` Open file selector <br>
*When in file selector* <br>
`Enter` to open the file at the specified filepath <br>
`Ctrl+Enter` to create a new file with inputted name <br>
`Ctrl+I/K or arrow keys` to move up and down

`Ctrl+T` Open integrated terminal <br>
`Ctrl+X` to remove entire line <br>
`Ctrl+S` save file <br>
`Ctrl+R` reload file <br>
`Ctrl+B` move to next closing bracket <br>
`Ctrl+F` toggle file search <br>
`Ctrl+Shift+F` remove all text in file search and close <br>
`Ctrl+M` Open keybinds menu in editor <br>

`Escape/Capslock` to switch editing modes (Edting = White cursor, Moving = Orange cursor) <br>
*while in moving mode* <br>
`I/K/J/L` to move up down left and right <br>
`Q/E` to go one character to the left/right <br>
`W/E` to go up/down quickly <br>
You cant type in moving mode
<br>

## Roadmap
